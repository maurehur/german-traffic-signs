# Traffic signs classification with a convolutional network

In this project, I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signs. The German Traffic Sign dataset consists of 43 different traffic sign with each image having 32Ã—32 px size. This dataset has 39,209 images as training data and 12,630 images as a test data. Each image is a photo of one of the 43 class of traffic sign. The dataset is public and you can download it using [data_Downloader](https://github.com/maurehur/data_downloader.git) repository.
